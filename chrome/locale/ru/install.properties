amo.description=Spamness introduces a color- and size-based visual measurement of how spam-like an individual message is based on its normalized SpamAssassin score. It also allows sorting of mail by score. To view messages received prior to installing this extension, bring up a context menu on the folder (normally right-click), then go to "Properties," then click on the "Rebuild Index" button.  Spamness expects to find the X-Spam-Status (capitalization irrelevant) in a message's headers. The format should look, in RegEx form, like ^X-Spam-Status: .+ (score|hits)=-?[0-9]+.[0-9] required=-?[0-9]+.[0-9]+ ?.?$. The most important part is the phrase score= or hits= followed by a floating point to the tenths place, followed by a space, and the phrase required= followed by a floating point to the tenths place, followed by either a space or nothing. They need not be in any order, they just need to be within the header as described. For example, X-Spam-Status: hits=95.0 required=1.9 would satisfy the format Spamness expects.
amo.developer_comments=Spamness is still under active development on <a href="https://github.com/voccs/spamness/">GitHub</a>.  Watch the project, file issues, and submit patches.
amo.release_notes=Spamness 0.6 fixes a number of bugs, particularly the ability to use a different SpamAssassin mail header, and adds a new matched rules display feature.
